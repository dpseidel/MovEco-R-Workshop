## Hong Kong University: Movement Ecology Workshop in R

In January 2018, my colleague [Eric Dougherty](https://ourenvironment.berkeley.edu/people/eric-dougherty) and I were invited to lead an 8-day workshop focused on
analysis of movement data in R. This was an exciting opportunity and we worked hard to pull together resources in order to teach students everything from the basics of loading a
shapefile in R all the way to simulating their own movement paths. All resources are hosted in a [public repository](https://github.com/dpseidel/MovEco-R-Workshop) 
and the [associated webpage](http://dpseidel.github.io/MovEco-R-Workshop) is a work in progress. I sincerely hope these resources can be of use to other instructors and researchers. I welcome people to use the repository and code 
as they see fit and I would be delighted to hear from others with suggestions regarding organization or new topics that should be included or would be of interest if we were to do this again or in a different capacity.

_This is an upper-division undergraduate course designed to introduce students in 
Berkeley's College of Natural Resources (CNR) to the fundamentals
of data science, while also introducing students majoring in Data Science or related fields to key issues
in global change ecology. This course is taught with an emphasis on using tidyverese in R, Rstudio, TravisCI, Git, & Github_

### ESPM-173: Introduction to Analysis of Ecological Data

- Taught: Fall 2016
