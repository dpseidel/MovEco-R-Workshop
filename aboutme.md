Hi Everyone! My name is Dana Paige Seidel (I respond to "Dana" and use she/her pronouns). I am a 4th year (last year!) PhD Candidate at UC Berkeley in the [Getz Lab](https://nature.berkeley.edu/getzlab) studying the movement of large mammals (think deer, zebra, and elephants) and the spread of disease. Professionally, I fancy myself a bio-statistician, a data scientist, and a part-time educator. Personally, I just love solving puzzles and other people's knotty technical problems. For more information on my research, mosey on over to my [research](https://dpseidel.github.io/research/) tab.

## My Past

I grew up in 4 houses and a family cabin up and down the central time zone and went to college in New York State (Go Big Red!). Since then I've continued my travels, studying abroad in Equatorial Guinea, working a season in rural Minnesota, completing my masters in Alberta, and finally settling down in Berkeley, CA. Amazingly, my family ended up near by and I enjoy seeing them often and revel in being the "adventure" aunt. In my free time, I lead a book club, network with other [#Rladies](https://twitter.com/RLadiesSF), hike, bike, and swim around East Bay, and generally seek out self-improvement and learning opportunities. 

## My Future

I'll be graduating with my Ph.D. as of December 2018 and looking for a new full time position in applied statistics or data science, to start January 2019. I'm especially keen to find a position where I can apply my spatial statistics experience. If you have a tip for me, would like to hire me, or would just like to wish me luck, please <a href="mailto:dana.seidel@gmail.com">contact me</a>. You can download my resume (written for a data science position) [here](), or for more information, an abbreviated CV [here]().
