Generally, my research focuses on the movement of large mammals and their diseases, especially those with environmental reservoirs. My primary system of investigation is anthrax in populations of African Elephant and zebra within Etosha National Park, Namibia. 

From 2015-2017, I was a fellow with a [NSF NRT project: Data Science for the 21st Century](http://ds421.berkeley.edu/) at Berkeley, training data scientists to analyse the social-environmental problems prompted by our rapidly changing global climate. I continue to [teach](https://dpseidel.github.io/teaching) with the program.

My masters research focused on elk populations in SW Alberta with [Dr. Mark Boyce](https://www.ualberta.ca/science/about-us/contact-us/faculty-directory/mark-boyce) and I continue to maintain connections there through a side project working to develop a system for updating risk maps of Chronic Wasting Disease.
