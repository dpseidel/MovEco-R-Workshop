Movement data
=============

As mentioned this morning, movement data may come in a variety of scales and resolutions, requiring careful consideration before analysis.

Here we are going to focus on GPS relocation data as it is one of the most common forms of tracking data and provides a (mostly) consistent record of an animals movement path.

Justr as there are multiple semi-cooperative packages in R for working with spatial data generaly, there are many packages in R used to handle movement data, and an ever growing number built for specific analyses. Unfortunately there is no strict consensus yet on which class movement data objects should be in across packages, and researchers often have to be comfortable converting from one to the other depending on the task at hand and the format required by each package. Although there are most definitely more R packages created for dealing with animal movement data, we are going to focus today on the two most prominent `move` and `adehabitatLT`.

To begin we are going to introduce Movebank and `Move` & `MoveStack` objects with the library `move`. Later we will introduce the `adehabitatLT` package and demonstrate how easy it is to pull out primary stepwise characteristics like step length, turning angle, and net displacement from our trajectories. These primary path characteristics will form the basis for many more complex movement analyses including our simulations later next week.

Movebank
--------

Though often researchers in your position will have data of your own, there has been an effort to share movement data from other collections through the Movebank database. Movebank is a free online infrastructure created to help researchers manage, share, analyze, and archive animal movement data. `move` is an R package that contains functions to access movement data stored in [movebank.org](http://www.movebank.org) as well as tools to visualize and statistically analyze animal movement data. `move` is addressing movement ecology questions that complement existing efforts such as `adeHabitat` and other packages which we will introduce later.

There are 3 ways to load movement data into R as a `move` object: 1. Using the movebank API 2. Directly loading movebank-formatted .csvs 3. Converting data from a traditional dataframe

Here let's consider some Albatross data, from movebank study \#2911040: To load data directly from the movebank API like I will here, you would need your own movebank username and password, here I have stored my password in my local environment as the variable `pass`.

``` r
loginStored <- movebankLogin(username="dpseidel", password=pass)

#search for studies - 
searchMovebankStudies(x="albatross", login=loginStored)
#get study ID - 
getMovebankStudy(2911040, login=loginStored)$citation

#check for animal IDs - 
getMovebankAnimals(2911040, login=loginStored)
#get the all data - getMovebankData()
#get only specific animal by specifying individual_id

albatross <- getMovebank("event", study_id = 2911040, login=loginStored)

write_tsv(albatross, "Study2911040")
# getMovebank("event", login, study_id,...): returns the sensor measurements from a study. 
# See also getMovebankData, getMovebankNonLocationData.
```

To save us the effort of getting you all Movebank logins at this point, I have provided the tsv. We can use this to demonstrate the 3rd way of loading in movement data.

``` r
study <- read_tsv("data_files/Study2911040", comment="##",
                  col_types = "Tnncc")
study <- as.data.frame(study)
                       
albatross <- move(x=study$location_long,
              y=study$location_lat,
              time=study$timestamp,
              data=study,
              animal = as.factor(study$individual_id),
              sensor = as.factor(study$tag_id),
              proj=CRS("+proj=longlat"))
```

    ## Warning in .local(x, y, time, data, proj, ...): There were NA locations
    ## detected and omitted. Currently they are not stored in unusedrecords

``` r

```

``` r
class(albatross)
```

    ## [1] "MoveStack"
    ## attr(,"package")
    ## [1] "move"

We've created our own MoveStack. We can plot it using the move::plot command and if we wish, `mapview()` which converts it to a `sf` object on the fly.

``` r
plot(albatross, type="l") # all of them
```

![](../Movement_Data_Path_Metrics_files/figure-markdown_github/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png)

If we are curious to compare behaviors across individuals, we can split the moveStack, into separte move objects with the command `split`

``` r
ids <- split(albatross)
```

This allows us to plot and manipulate the individuals separately:

``` r
plot(ids[[1]], type='l')
```

![](../Movement_Data_Path_Metrics_files/figure-markdown_github/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png)

``` r
plot(ids[[28]], type='l')
```

![](../Movement_Data_Path_Metrics_files/figure-markdown_github/unnamed-chunk-6-2.png)

``` r
par(mfrow=c(2,2))
plot(ids[[1]], type='l', main= names(ids[1]))
plot(ids[[2]], type='l', main= names(ids[2]))
plot(ids[[3]], type='l', main= names(ids[3]))
plot(ids[[4]], type='l', main= names(ids[4]))
```

![](../Movement_Data_Path_Metrics_files/figure-markdown_github/unnamed-chunk-6-3.png)

``` r
par(mfrow=c(1,1))
```

And of course, just as before, we can manipulate, and clean up, this data easily when converted to an sf object:

``` r
albatross_sf <- 
  study %>% na.omit() %>%
  st_as_sf(coords = c("location_long", "location_lat"), crs=4326)
```

For instance, in this state, it's simple to look at how many records we have per individual:

``` r
albatross_sf %>% 
  group_by(individual_id) %>% 
  tally()
```

Or map the paths of a particular pair:

``` r
albatross_sf %>% 
  filter(individual_id %in% c(2911059,2911062)) %>% 
  mapview(zcol="individual_id")
```

![](../Movement_Data_Path_Metrics_files/figure-markdown_github/unnamed-chunk-9-1.png)

and easily convert it back to a `movestack` as needed.

``` r
as(albatross_sf, 'Spatial') %>% as(., "MoveStack") 
```

There is lots more the `move` package has to offer but for now, we are going to move onto ltraj objects and the primary path characteristics they make so easy to extract. We will come back to the `move` package tomorrow when we discuss methods for estimating home ranges.

Ltraj objects
-------------

The class ltraj is intended to store trajectories of animals. `ltraj` objects function neatly as lists, similar in some ways to the list of Move objects that was created when we split out albatross MoveStack. A key difference between Move and ltraj objects is not only in the structure of data but also the attributes calculated. Ltraj ojects automatically calculate common path characteristics like step length, relative turning angle, absolute turning angle, and net squared displacement from which much of subsequent movement modelling builds off of. Additionally from these primary path characteristics it's simple to calculate secondary statistics like sinuosity, residence time, or directional persistence.

`ltrajs` can be created from a traditional data frames, spatial dataframes, or directly from move objects using the command `as.ltraj` and, in the case of the dataframes, specifying the coordinates.

``` r
# from move object
alba_ltraj  <- as(albatross, 'ltraj')
```

    ## Warning in asMethod(object): Converting a long lat projected object while
    ## the ltraj does not deal with long lat projected data

``` r

```

    ##  infolocs provided. The following variables are available:
    ## [1] "sensor"        "timestamp"     "location_lat"  "location_long"

Note all the information the this class gives us up front. Not only can we see the number of relocations from each of our animals we can see exactly the duration of each "burst" and that this is an "irregular" "Type2" trajectory. Just what exactly does that mean?

### Side note: types of trajectory

The adehabitat packages, and ltraj objects, distinguish between 2 types of trajectories: 1. Trajectories of type I are characterized by the fact that the time is not precisely known or not taken into account for the relocations of the trajectory (i.e. sampling of tracks in snow) 2. Trajectories of type II are characterized by the fact that the time is known for each relocation. This type of trajectory is in turn be divided into two subtypes: – regular trajectories: these trajectories are characterized by a constant time lag between successive relocations; – irregular trajectories: these trajectories are characterized by a variable time lag between successive relocations

It's worth emphasizing that functions in `adehabitatLT` are mainly designed to deal with type I or type II regular trajectories. Irregular trajectories are harder to analyze as their descriptive parameters may not be compared when computed on different time lags.

### Side note: Making an irregular trajectory regular.

From here on out we are going to work with some ibex data already formatted as ltrajs and provided by the adehabitatLT package. First we want to load both the *regular* trajectory data "ibex" and the raw *irregular* trajectory "ibexraw" just to get a sense of the difference.

``` r

data(ibexraw)

From a simple histogram on the first individual of raw data, we can see there are some big time gaps.

``` r
hist(ibexraw[1], "dt", freq = TRUE)
```

![](../Movement_Data_Path_Metrics_files/figure-markdown_github/unnamed-chunk-13-1.png)

Looking at this rawibex data, we can see that the median `dt` is:

``` r
median(ibexraw[[1]]$dt)
```

    ## [1] 14411

From that we can expect that the unit was set to take a fix every 14400 seconds (4 hrs). To regularize a trajectory like this one that is not too irregular - we need to round our dt's and insert missing values where needed. Keep in mind, not all trajectories can or should be regularized - we will touch on more advanced methods for dealling with these next week.

In this case, we need to make our first timestamp exact and set the missing values accordingly:

``` r
ibex153_raw <- ibexraw[1]
ibex153_raw[[1]]$date <- lubridate::force_tz(ibex153_raw[[1]]$date, "GMT") # hack to simplify timezones. 

## The reference date: the hour should be exact (i.e. minutes=0):
ref <- strptime("00:00:00", "%H:%M:%S", tz="GMT")

    ## [1] TRUE

Now our trajectory is regular and we can trust and compare all those primary path characteristics we care about!

Primary Path Characteristics
============================

If we dig into any one of our ltraj list objects, we'll see a dataframe containing certain basic characteristics from our paths. Specifically:

-   Step Length (i.e `dist`): the distance between successive relocations is often used in animal movement analysis (e.g. Root and Kareiva 1984, Marsh and Jones 1988);

-   Turning Angle (`rel.angle` v. `abs.angle`)

Your relative turning angle measures the change of direction between the step built by relocations i − 1 and i and the step built by relocations i and i + 1 (what we generally refer to as “turning angle”). It is often used together with the parameter dist to fit movement models (e.g. Root and Kareiva 1984, Marsh and Jones 1988). For comparison the absolute angle is the angle between the x direction and the step built by relocations i and i + 1.

-   Net Squared Displacement, i.e R2n,the squared distance between the first relocation of the trajectory and the current relocation is often used to test some movements models (e.g. the correlated random walk, see the seminal paper of Kareiva and Shigesada, 1983).

These are just a few of the metrics you might want to derive from your paths. Additional secondary characteristics include *straightness*, *sinuosity*, *directional persistence*, *persistence velocity*, *residence time*, *time to return*, and more. We will encounter many of these on later days of this workshop.

In addition to the derivation of these primary and secondary path cahracteristics, adehabitatLT is especially useful for path segementation and some simple movement models. We will get more into these analyses at a later date. If interested, I highly recommend consulting the packages very thourough documentation.
