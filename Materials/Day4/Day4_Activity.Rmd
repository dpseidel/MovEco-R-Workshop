```{r setup, include=FALSE}

```

We are going to explore some of the functionality that we have demonstrated on example paths:

- 1. Select s and k (or a or r) values and build a T-LoCoH home range from your data or another data source. Why/how did you select those parameters?

- 2. Plot the revisitation and duration values. What biological explanation can you offer to explain the pattern visible in this plot?

- 3. Use the T-LoCoH documentation to find the function for exporting a shapefile based on your isopleths or hulls. Bring that object back into your environment using the appropriate `sf` command. Then sample 100 points (once again using the `sf` package) from within the home range you defined earlier.
