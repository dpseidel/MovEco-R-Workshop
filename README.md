# Files
- The workshop schedule is found in the [Schedule.pdf](https://github.com/dpseidel/MovEco-R-Workshop/blob/master/Schedule.pdf), produced by the `Schedule.Rmd`, both found in the main directory. 
- All files, including slides, live coding scripts, and activities are found sorted into directories according to workshop day in the `Materials/` directory.
- The [Extra Materials](https://github.com/dpseidel/MovEco-R-Workshop/tree/master/Materials/Extra%20Materials/) directory contains additional scripts and resources that we did not get to cover fully in the course of the workshop but may be of interest. 

# Acknowledgements
Eric & I stand on the shoulders of giants and still have much to learn.
Much of this code is adapted from other resources produced by the [#Rstats](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23rstats&src=typd) community at large. We make an effort to cite these resources throughout our materials where appropriate but would like to specifically acknowledge the contributions of Andy Lyons, Brianna Abrahms, Clement Calenge, Hadley Wickham, Garrett Grolemund, Carl Boettiger, and Jamie Afflerbach that have influenced this workshop.
